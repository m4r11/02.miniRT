# miniRT
## Mini raytracing engine implementation -> rendering of simple CGI.

###### Testing parsing
```
gcc -g  rtlib.h get_next_line.h get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c test_parse.c
./a.out scene_test.rt 
```

###### Subject
```
"This project is an introduction to the beautiful world of Raytracing.  
 Once completed you will be able to render simple Computer-Generated-Images"
```
###### About
```
"In nature, a light source emits a ray of light which travels, eventually,  
to a surface that interrupts its progress. One can think of this "ray" as a stream of photons  
traveling along the same path. In a perfect vacuum this ray will be a straight line  
(ignoring relativistic effects). Any combination of four things might happen with this  
light ray: absorption, reflection, refraction and fluorescence. "
```
```
Instead of following the light path from it's source, wich would result in unnecessary  
computation, the basic idea is to reverse the light path from the "eye" or "camera".

## Steps
```
0-> Collecting resources to suport my research
1-> Exploring minilibx && math.h functions
2-> Install Xquartz for window (u actually don't need this with minilxlib)
3-> test.c to init mlx && open window (basic window management) 
4-> test2.c pushing pixels to the window
5-> learned: vectors, 3D graphics fundamentals.  
6-> found vector lib made by Mashpoe and I'm going to try that out. made sense to have   vectors as arrays with it's special name instead of a structure.  

```

## Glossary
```
endian: denoting or relating to two systems of ordering data, in which the most   significant unit is put either first or last.  
radian: is a pure measure based on the Radius of the circle. To go from radians to   degrees: multiply by 180, divide by π. To go from degrees to radians: multiply by π,   divide by 180   
float Degrees = Radians * 180.0f / 3.14159265359f  
float Radian = Degrees * 3.14159265359f / 180.0f  
The C language uses radians instead of degrees when calculating angles. Humans should   use radians as well, as they're logical and easy to work with (radians, not humans).
