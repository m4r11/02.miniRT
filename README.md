# miniRT
## Mini raytracing engine implementation -> rendering of simple CGI.

###### Subject
```
"This project is an introduction to the beautiful world of Raytracing.  
 Once completed you will be able to render simple Computer-Generated-Images"
```
###### About
```
"In nature, a light source emits a ray of light which travels, eventually,  
to a surface that interrupts its progress. One can think of this "ray" as a stream of photons  
traveling along the same path. In a perfect vacuum this ray will be a straight line  
(ignoring relativistic effects). Any combination of four things might happen with this  
light ray: absorption, reflection, refraction and fluorescence. "
```
```
Instead of of following the light path from it's source, wich would result in unnecessary  
computation, the basic idea is to reverse the light path from the "eye" or "camera".

## Steps
 ```
0-> Collecting resources to suport my research
1-> Exploring minilibx && math.h functions
2-> Install Xquartz for window
3-> test.c to init mlx && open window (basic window management) 
4-> test2.c pushing pixels to the window
```
